# Language Playground

Daniel Connolly

### Overview

The language playground is intended as a place for me to test out new languages via online tutorials or mini projects. I hope it will allow me to improve the breadth of my knowledge and programming experience.

#### Languages Covered:

1. Haskell -> I hope to learn some functional programming and get better with recursion.

2. Ruby on Rails

3. Golang
