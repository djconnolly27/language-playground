# Building a Simple Container in Go

Followed this tutorial to build a simple container: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utf-A4rODH8

To get this to fully work, it would require a copy of a linux filesystem, for example. This would serve as the "image" for a docker container.

I learned a bit more about container from the gist found here: https://www.infoq.com/articles/build-a-container-golang/.
